# sql-challenge

## Background
The goal of this project was to conduct research about people who the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. I was tasked with designing the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database and then answer questions about the data.

For this challenge, no outside support was used. I did have trouble with number 8 and thus this challenge is not fully complete. I plan on resubmitting this assignment depending on my grade.

It is important to note that on the rubric for this assignment, it says that Primary Keys should be set for all tables. However, for the 'dept_emp' table, both columns had reoccuring values, and thus I could not create a primary key for that table.
