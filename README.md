# sql-challenge

For this challenge, no outside support was used. I did have trouble with number 8 and thus this challenge is not fully complete. I plan on resubmitting this assignment depending on my grade.

It is important to note that on the rubric for this assignment, it says that Primary Keys should be set for all tables. However, for the 'dept_emp' table, both columns had reoccuring values, and thus I could not create a primary key for that table.
